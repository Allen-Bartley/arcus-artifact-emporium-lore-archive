# üßÆ Recovered Files ‚Äì Technical Conversion Process

This document describes the step-by-step methodology used to recover and convert legacy Microsoft Works documents into modern `.docx` format for archival and presentation purposes. The original materials originated from a long-running forum-based RPG project and were stored in legacy file formats that are no longer natively supported.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment & Preparation

- **Virtualization**: Utilized an existing Windows 7 Ultimate virtual machine set up in VirtualBox.
- **Legacy Software**: Acquired an ISO of *Microsoft Works* from the Internet Archive and mounted it onto the VM.
- **Installation**: Installed Microsoft Works Word Processor within the VM to enable file opening and editing of `.wps` documents.

---

## üì§ File Acquisition & ISO Creation

- Original RPG files were compiled into a dedicated folder.
- Used **ImgBurn** to create a custom ISO image from the folder contents.
- Mounted the ISO as a virtual disc within the VM for file access.

## üìù File Conversion Workflow

- Opened legacy `.wps` files in *Microsoft Works Word Processor*.
- Saved each file in the modern `.docx` format using the 2007 compatibility option.

---

## üîå File Transfer Challenges & Solutions

- **Initial Attempt**: Tried transferring files via Google Drive inside the VM, but encountered persistent connectivity issues.
- **Alternative Approach**:
  - Connected a USB drive formatted in FAT32 for compatibility between host and guest systems.
  - Enabled USB passthrough so the VM could detect and interact with the USB device.
  - Archived all converted `.docx` files into a ZIP and transferred them to the host computer via USB.

## ‚úÖ Post-Conversion Verification

- Opened each `.docx` file on the host system using Microsoft Word to confirm formatting integrity and readability.
- Files were then uploaded to GitHub and summarized within the [converted_file_index.md](converted_file_index.md) for archival reference.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Notes on File Organization

- The `/converted` folder contains cleaned and documented `.docx` files for readability.
- The `/legacy_originals` folder includes the original Microsoft Works files for historical reference.
- All flavor summaries and lore annotations are styled for accessibility and light roleplay immersion, while keeping technical documentation separate for resume reviewers and archivists.

This recovery process required the integration of virtualization, legacy software compatibility, file system configuration, and data transfer troubleshooting. It demonstrates a multi-disciplinary approach to digital preservation and retroactive documentation.
