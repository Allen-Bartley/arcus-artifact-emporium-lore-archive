# 🧪 Arcus' Artifact Emporium Lore Archive

Welcome to the multiversal vault of *Arcus Acer* — Myr Mage, artificer extraordinaire, and quiet steward of planar mysteries.

This GitHub repository serves as a digital restoration project for the long-lost worldbuilding and RPG history surrounding the **Academy of Magic** universe. Originating in 2005 from a fanfiction crossover (*Magic: The Gathering vs. Yu-Gi-Oh!*), the setting expanded through forums, Scratchpad Wiki pages, and collaborative roleplay threads — many of which now exist only in personal archives.

## 🛠️ Restoration Highlights

- Resurrected early-2000s `.wps` files from personal archives using Microsoft Works inside a Windows 7 VM
- Converted recovered files into modern formats (`.rtf`, `.docx`, `.png`) for accessibility
- Preserved crest artwork, forum roleplay threads, decklists, tutoring logs, and custom lore
- Reconstructed character profiles, faction affiliations, and flavor entries from scratchpad wiki remnants
- Documented community history and splintering events for historical context
